0.2 plans to be a rewrite of the internal structure of FunctionRotator.

A lot more error checking will be done. Classes will be more modular.

Changes:
PlotEngine's method will be restricted (Methods like defineFunction() will disappear).
A new group of classes will be made representing function types. So far the list classes is
Normal2DFunction
Normal3DFunction
Parametric2DFunction
Parametric3DFunction
PolarFunction

Each class will perform error checking to make sure a function is well formed.

Functions will be able to refer to each other (and other variables) through a FunctionNamespace. A FunctionNamespace will allow
the declaring and defining functions.

Note that my v1.0, FunctionRotator will have a new plotting software - perhaps MathGL, JFreeChart, or JZY3D. Suggestions are welcome!
